# CatRealoded-BackEnd-Task.
## Welcome!

Hi, I'm Ahmed Gamal! Thank you for checking out this repository. This repository showcases a **Back-End Task for the CatRealoded Team**, Feel free to explore the code, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.

Enjoy!


## Build Something Useful!
**User Registration and Authentication System**
## Features
1.**User Registration:**\
Accepts Username, Email, and Password.\
Checks if the email is already registered and prompts the user to try another email if it is.\
2.**User Login:**\
Verifies if the provided Email exists.\
Confirms that the Password matches the registered email.\
3.**Exit:**\
Terminates the program.

#### Steps:
1- I created a file as a storage for users information -> **Username, Email, Password**.\
2- An infinite loop for the user to do more than one thing, such as register, then login, or exit.\
3- In the loop, the user will choose one of 3 options, and the system will make the choice based on that.\
4- The registration method takes the username, email and password from the user and checks if he has registered before. It will tell him to try another email.\
5- In the login method, make sure that the email exists, and if it exists, make sure that the password that the user entered is appropriate for the email or not.\
6- and there is a third choice --> Exit -> it terminates the program.




## Lets discuss The Problem Solving Question :) :

This program takes a string input from the user. It increments or decrements a counter (Intialized to zero) based on the presence of "++" or "--" pairs respectively. The counter is then displayed.\ 
1- First made a string variable --> s.\
2- intialized to variables --> Counter = zero , n --> The Length of the string.\
3- Make a Loop that go through the string characters and compare a pair of characters then Increments or decrements the counter.\
4- Finally print the counter.


## Okay Now SQL Challenges Task:

First I Created DATABASE Called CatRealoded_Task.\
Then Created a TABLE inside it called Products that includes **product_id**, **product_name**, **is_recyclable**, **is_low_fat**.\
Then Inserted the data that you put in the task inside the table.\
Then Selected **product_id** and **product_name** that must be **recyclable** and **low-fat**.
