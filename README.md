# CatRealoded-BackEnd-Task.






## Lets discuss The Problem Solving Question :) :

This program takes a string input from the user. It increments or decrements a counter (Intialized to zero) based on the presence of "++" or "--" pairs respectively. The counter is then displayed.\ 
1- First made a string variable --> s.\
2- intialized to variables --> Counter = zero , n --> The Length of the string.\
3- Make a Loop that go through the string characters and compare a pair of characters then Increments or decrements the counter.\
4- Finally print the counter.\


## Okay Now SQL Challenges Task:

First I Created DATABASE Called CatRealoded_Task.\
Then Created a TABLE inside it called Products that includes **product_id**, **product_name**, **is_recyclable**, **is_low_fat**.\
Then Inserted the data that you put in the task inside the table.\
Then Selected **product_id** and **product_name** that must be **recyclable** and **low-fat**.
