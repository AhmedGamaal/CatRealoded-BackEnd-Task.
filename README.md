##Lets discuss The Problem Solving Question :) :

This program takes a string input from the user. It increments or decrements a counter (Intialized to zero) based on the presence of "++" or "--" pairs respectively. The counter is then displayed. 
1- First made a string variable --> s
2- intialized to variables --> Counter = zero , n --> The Length of the string.
3- Make a Loop that go through the string characters and compare a pair of characters then Increments or decrements the counter.
4- Finally print the counter.
